Actually, you don't run npm run dev anywhere when using Onlook!

To restart the dev server in Onlook, you would:

Stop the project in Onlook (there should be a stop button or option in the Onlook interface)
Start it again in Onlook (using Onlook's start/run button)
Onlook manages the dev server for you automatically - you don't need to use any terminal commands. The restart happens entirely within the Onlook application interface.

localhost:3000/

No, you don't run git commands in Onlook.

For git operations, you would use:

Terminal/Command Line - Open a terminal, navigate to your project folder (/Users/nandesnorg/Desktop/LLMs/onlook_sites/bookgroup), and run git commands like git add ., git commit -m "message", git push, etc.

VSCode - If you have VSCode open, you can use its built-in Git interface (Source Control panel) or the integrated terminal

Git GUI applications - Like GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, etc.

Onlook is specifically for:

Running the dev server
Visual editing of your React components
Live preview and design changes
Everything else (git, npm install, file management, etc.) you do through your normal development tools - terminal, VSCode, etc.

So to summarize:

Onlook: Dev server, visual editing
Terminal/VSCode: Git, npm commands, file operations

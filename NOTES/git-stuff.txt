'https://github.com/nannigan/bookgroup.git'
git remote set-url command, followed by the remote name (usually "origin") and the new URL
git remote set-url 'origin' 'https://github.com/nannigan/bookgroup.git'


Deleted ResistorSistersBookgroup repository 
vscode thought it was still the url for the remote so changed  as above

pretty sure git actions includes build and got run failed emails from GitHub while it seems like something I tried did not fail... ie run dev followed by git commands when I made updates locally
git add .
git commit -m "whatever"
git push origin main

Actually, you don't run npm run dev anywhere when using Onlook!

To restart the dev server in Onlook, you would:

Stop the project in Onlook (there should be a stop button or option in the Onlook interface)
Start it again in Onlook (using Onlook's start/run button)
Onlook manages the dev server for you automatically - you don't need to use any terminal commands. The restart happens entirely within the Onlook application interface.

trying to implement jsonbin
turns out API key I used in .ev.local and in GitHub pages secrets had a $ as the first character which is a mistake I copied in- shouldn't start with $
fixed both of those things- 
NOW
git hub shows failure of deployment notices
localhost:300 from 5pm run dev in vscode still shows using local storage
tried following directions to programatically add a bin and get it's id that wayNO GO
went back to JSONbin and create new bin there with json from current dummy books
got and bin id and put it in /lib/jsonbin-storage.ts
// Public JSONBin configuration - no API key needed for users!
const PUBLIC_BIN_ID = '6865e4868561e97a50308e97';

pushed all to GitHub
still getting local storage only on local host an Pages 





6-28-25 ditched ResisterSistersBookgroup repository to get vscode to git to correct repo... in git note thing
now it's up 
added github actions extension--

lots of to and fro with git and workflows to get it up
Can I change the name

my edits in Onlook interface simple workflow to live:
in VSCode
nom run build
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main


6-27-25 Using Onlook-  see last git stuff in chat history
JSONbin not sure how it is integrated

Used git integration in VScode to  push code up but it went to /bookgroup instead of the newly created ResisterSistersBooks repository
trouble shooting git stuff- want to change origin in vscode to newly created ResisterSistersBooks repository so can use git tool in vscode- not working git merge conflicts?

Also can I just upload the â€˜outâ€™ directory (contents) created with rpm run build to GitHub repository- NO looks like simple static pages only


trying to get GitHub pages running at  https://nannigan.github.io/ResistorSistersBooks/

via https://github.com/nannigan/ResistorSistersBooks/settings/pages


lots of erroring out of rpm run build not sure if itâ€™s about just typescript junk but EVENTUALLY is ran run build successfully


The build should now complete successfully! You can deploy theÂ outÂ folder to GitHub Pages and your book club members can start using it immediately.
ðŸ“šÂ How it Works:
	1	AdminÂ deploys to GitHub Pages
	2	MembersÂ visit the URL
	3	EveryoneÂ can add/edit books instantly
	4	DataÂ syncs automatically between all users

Creating a web app for your book club is a fantastic idea! Below is a high-level overview of the steps you'll need to take to build this application. I'll outline the basic components and technologies you can use to achieve your goals.

Step 1: Define Requirements

User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Book Database: Store book information such as title, author, genre, summary, and possibly reviews.

Add/Edit Books: Allow users to add new books to the database and edit existing entries.

View/Search Books: Provide a way for users to view and search for books in the database.

Book Club Features: Additional features like discussion forums, reading lists, and meeting schedules.

Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js or Vue.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js or Django
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB ??
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2
Deployment: Hosting services like Heroku, AWS, or Netlify
Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Node.js and npm: Download from Node.js.
Install a Database: Install PostgreSQL or MongoDB on your local machine.
Create a Project Directory: Set up a folder for your project.
Step 4: Build the Backend
Initialize a Node.js Project:

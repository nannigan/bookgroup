Now I can see the book card implementation. I need to replace the star rating section with a comment field. I'll need to:

Update the book data structure to include comments instead of ratings
Update the book card display to show comments instead of star ratings
Update the form to have a comment field instead of rating
Let me implement these changes:

const [books, setBooks] = useState([
        {
            id: 1,
            title: 'The Great Gatsby',
            author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
            genre: 'Classic',
            status: 'Read',
            comment: 'A masterpiece of American literature with beautiful prose.',
        },
        {

const [newBook, setNewBook] = useState({
        title: '',
        author: '',
        genre: '',
        status: 'Want to Read',
        comment: '',
    });
setNewBook({ title: '', author: '', genre: '', status: 'Want to Read', comment: '' });
setNewBook({ title: '', author: '', genre: '', status: 'Want to Read', comment: '' });
setNewBook({
                                        title: '',
                                        author: '',
                                        genre: '',
                                        status: 'Want to Read',
                                        comment: '',
                                    });
<div className="space-y-3" data-oid="c2qbbfh">
                                <span
                                    className={`px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium ${getStatusColor(book.status)}`}
                                    data-oid="r5_1rt:"
                                >
                                    {book.status}
                                </span>
                                {book.comment && (
                                    <div className="bg-gray-5
<div data-oid="h51srsg">
                                <label
                                    className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1"
                                    data-oid="2pq_-yc"
                                >
                                    Comment
                                </label>
                                <textarea
                                    value={newBook.comment}
                                    onChange={(e) =>

I've successfully replaced the star number rating system with a comment system on the book cards. Here's what I changed:

Updated the book data structure: Replaced the rating field with a comment field for all sample books, adding meaningful comments for each book.

Modified the book card display: Replaced the star rating section with a comment display that shows the comment in a styled gray box with italic text when a comment exists.

Updated the form: Changed the rating input field to a textarea for comments, allowing users to write longer thoughts about their books.

Updated all state management: Changed all instances of rating: 0 to comment: '' in the newBook state initialization and reset functions.

The book cards now display user comments instead of numerical ratings, providing a more personal and descriptive way to track thoughts about each book. The comments are displayed in an attractive gray box below the status badge, and the form now includes a textarea for entering comments instead of a number input for ratings.

Let me check the main page and components to find the book card implementation:

read_files
{
  "paths": [
    "/Users/nandesnorg/Desktop/LLMs/onlook/project-1750456071401/app/page.tsx"
  ]
}
I'll help you replace the star number rating with a comment on the book card. First, let me explore the project structure to understand the current implementation.

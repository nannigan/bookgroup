bolt.diy getting started tutorial

bolt.diy

https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy?tab=readme-ov-file#features

on bolt.diy github page click code buton- copy url
then run git clone https://the url/

cd to the bolt.diy directory
npm install
npm run dev

reload page on localhost:5173
(in output after npm run dev)

pick the llm from the options-- it will take you to the right path to get the api key
(further reasearch to figure out which is best for project and cheap or free )

then in the chat you ask for what you want to do Example being -create a simple todo list with React and Tailwind

didn't really work easily... took too long and showed error messages that seem to indicate the model wasn't up to the task (free versions)

 message: 'Insufficient Balance',
      type: 'unknown_error',
      param: null,
      code: 'invalid_request_error'
    }
Also console on localhost showed gooey errors     

lots of llms to chose from but curently
seems like way more trouble than it's worth going down endless rabbit holes for---

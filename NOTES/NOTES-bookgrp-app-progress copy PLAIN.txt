learning too!!!




6-28-25 ditched ResisterSistersBookgroup repository to get vscode to git to correct repo... in git note thing
now it's up 
added github actions extension--

lots of to and fro with git and workflows to get it up
Can I change the name

git simple workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main


6-27-25 Using Onlook-  see last git stuff in chat history
JSONbin not sure how it is integrated

Used git integration in VScode to  push code up but it went to /bookgroup instead of the newly created ResisterSistersBooks repository
trouble shooting git stuff- want to change origin in vscode to newly created ResisterSistersBooks repository so can use git tool in vscode- not working git merge conflicts?

Also can I just upload the â€˜outâ€™ directory (contents) created with rpm run build to GitHub repository- NO looks like simple static pages only


trying to get GitHub pages running at  https://nannigan.github.io/ResistorSistersBooks/

via https://github.com/nannigan/ResistorSistersBooks/settings/pages


lots of erroring out of rpm run build not sure if itâ€™s about just typescript junk but EVENTUALLY is ran run build successfully


The build should now complete successfully! You can deploy theÂ outÂ folder to GitHub Pages and your book club members can start using it immediately.
ðŸ“šÂ How it Works:
	1	AdminÂ deploys to GitHub Pages
	2	MembersÂ visit the URL
	3	EveryoneÂ can add/edit books instantly
	4	DataÂ syncs automatically between all users


JSONBin supposed to be easy set up with GH pages which is an easy way to deploy React app
